//! A cross-process lock for one scheduled pipeline run.
//!
//! Duckle has two schedulers: the desktop app runs one inside the Tauri
//! process, and `duckle-runner serve` runs another. Both guard themselves in
//! process - a semaphore in one, a condvar gate in the other - and neither
//! knows the other exists. Point both at the same workspace, which is exactly
//! what happens while promoting a workspace from a laptop to a server, and the
//! same schedule fires twice at the same instant: two runs writing the same
//! sink, and two runs advancing the same `xf.incremental` watermark, which is
//! how a load silently skips rows.
//!
//! The lock is the operating system's, not ours. On Windows the file is opened
//! with no sharing, so a second opener is refused; on Unix the descriptor takes
//! a non-blocking `flock`. Both are released by the kernel when the handle
//! closes, which includes the process being killed or crashing - so a run that
//! dies mid-flight cannot wedge a schedule forever, and there is no stale-lock
//! timeout to tune or get wrong.
//!
//! Acquisition never waits. A schedule that is already running elsewhere is
//! skipped for this tick rather than queued, because the next tick will come
//! around anyway and a queue of identical overdue runs is not useful.
